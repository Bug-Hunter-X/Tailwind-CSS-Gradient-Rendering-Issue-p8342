```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS's gradient feature. However, if the `from` and `to` colors are too similar, or if there's an issue with the browser's rendering engine, the gradient might not be visible, appearing as a solid color instead.  This isn't a syntax error, but a visual bug that is hard to debug because it doesn't throw any error messages.
