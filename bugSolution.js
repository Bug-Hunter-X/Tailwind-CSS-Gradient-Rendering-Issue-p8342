```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This corrected version uses more distinct colors (`from-blue-500` and `to-purple-200`) to ensure a clearly visible gradient. If the problem still persists, investigate browser-specific rendering behavior using your browser's developer tools.  You might also consider using different gradient techniques, like using an image as a background or exploring alternative CSS gradient implementations if needed.
